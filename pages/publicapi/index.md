Here's the beta version of our realtime API feed: https://birch.catenarymaps.org/get_realtime_locations/orangecountytransportationauthority/bus/0/0. Right now, as you can tell from the URL, it's displaying the feed information for OCTA buses, but you can poke around and try other agencies/modalities, such as https://birch.catenarymaps.org/get_realtime_locations/metro~losangeles/metro/0/0 (LA Metro). 
You can locate available agencies from this map: https://maps.catenarymaps.org/chateausee, the API link is basically organized so that you just have to plug the agency name as spelled from the Chateausee map and its modality (bus, metro, ferry, etc.) into the link and it should give you the desired data:  https://birch.catenarymaps.org/get_realtime_locations/%7Bagency-name%7D/%7Bmodality%7D/0/0.
