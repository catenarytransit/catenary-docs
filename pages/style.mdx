# Catenary Style Guide

**Catenary's brand design and style reflects our identity and community.** Having a consistent Catenary brand helps identify us to users and provide meaningful information. Catenary is all about helping people get where they're going, so we need to make sure real-time information and the latest updates are really easy to access and view. When people see transit information, they need to be able to associate it quickly with Catenary and see that as trustworthy and valuable.

## Logo

Catenary's logo assets should be iconic and instantly recognizable, which is why we limit their use. If there's one thing you take away from this style guide - it should be this.

<img src="/c-logomark.svg" style={{height:'50px',marginTop:'30px',marginBottom:'30px'}} />

This is the Catenary logomark (logo + name). Original files for both the logo and logomark can be found [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19u-SvfRwg1fRg4lnmq35Tr8FiOcyZGDC). Always start with one of these original files. Do not use files from Figma, as these can be work-in-progress or limited edition versions.

Do not modify the logo in any way. Special edition logos are solely distributed by the communications team on social channels and never appear in products. You may recolor the logo in white or black if necessary.

## Color

Catenary's brand relies on a simple, readable, duotone color palette that allows us to convey a straightforward and informative brand.

Catenary Blue is **#<span style={{color:"#00AB9B"}}>00AB9B</span>**. This is our primary color and should be used as an accent wherever possible. Catenary Blue should generally appear on a white background. If a secondary "surface" background color is required, use **#F3F3F3**.

## Name

What does "Catenary" mean to you? We want it to be instantly related to our product and community - fast, reliable, and functional. It's a lot better than "Kyler's Transit Map", so we want to make sure we treat our name with respect.

The Catenary tagline is **"We get there together."** It should be displayed prominently on marketing materials and merchandise.

## Typography

Our brand relies on being clear and legible. Fonts help us do that. [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow) is our primary font. [Departure Mono](https://departuremono.com/) is our secondary font for decorative purposes only. No other font should be used in any communications. For internal documents, if Barlow is not available, DIN or any DIN variant may be used.

Please keep these basic typographical rules in mind:
* All body text should be flush left/rag right
* DO NOT justify text under any circumstances, this creates awkward gaps
* Use periods in phone numbers, for example 123.456.7890
* DO NOT use periods in addresses or after am/pm
* Avoid and fix both orphans and widows in body text

## Voice

The Catenary brand voice is optimistic, approachable, and irreverent.

Do these things!
* Talk as if we are Catenary, not your individual voice
* Speak in lower-case whenever possible
* Follow all applicable stylizations (e.g. "*Rapid*" or "Metro A Line" instead of "MTS Rapid" or "(A)"
* Be aware of jokes and memes
* Use the active voice when possible
* Be optimistic about the future of transit
* Advocate for better transit and transit projects when backing up agency messaging
* Keep posts short and use lots of images

Don't do these things!
* Use overly technical terms
* Demean transit riders for riding transit
* Go too hard on trolling, past the point where someone asks us to stop
* Get involved in political fights, even local
* Endorse candidates or policy changes (it may be appropriate to advocate for some policies but please check)
