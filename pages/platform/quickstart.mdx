# Getting started with the Catenary API

In this quick start guide, you'll learn how to get started with the Catenary API. We'll walk you through installing the SDK and making a simple trip information display that shows where a bus or rail trip will stop (and when).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need to have the following:

* A browser or Node.js environment
* A text editor
* Basic knowledge of JavaScript

## Install the SDK

The Catenary SDK is a simple library that makes it easy to interact with the Catenary API. Currently, it's only available for JavaScript environments, so you can install it using a CDN (like jsDelivr) or any package manager.

```bash copy
npm install catenarytransit
```

## Make your first request

First, let's import the SDK and make a simple request to get a list of the currently active trips for a specific agency, then pick one and list the stops on route. These instructions assume you're using a Node.js environment. If you're loading the SDK from a CDN, you can skip the import step. All necessary methods will be prefixed by ``window.catenary{:js}``.

```javascript copy
import { getTrips, getTrip } from 'catenarytransit';

async function random_trip() {
    const trips = await getTrips('san-diego-mts');
    const trip = trips[Math.floor(Math.random() * trips.length)];
    const stops = await getTrip('san-diego-mts', trip.id);
    console.log(stops);
}
```
