# Intro to the Catenary API

The Catenary API is a RESTful API that provides access to schedule and real-time transit data. It's designed to be easy to use, taking raw GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data directly from agencies and providing a simple, consistent interface for developers to access it. The Catenary API abstracts away boilerplate and agency-specific weirdness, providing clean stop, station, and route data that's easy to work with.
