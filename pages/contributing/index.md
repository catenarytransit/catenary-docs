## So you want to become a Catenary Developer

Alright, so you checked out our project, and you decided that you want to pitch in. Now what?

Great news: We don't require any background! All you need to start is something that can run code, some time, and willingness to learn! And since, you're here already, you probably got all three. 

Now, you must be asking, is there any bad news?

Well, it depends: There's a bit of reading you have to do, but we did our best to lay it all out. And if you have any questions about *anything*—literally anything from how our software works, what in Iter in Rust does, to when Kyler will do another maid costume ride—go right ahead and ask us at our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bBeDhrzSgz)! We also take emails at [contact@catenarymaps.org](mailto:contact@catenarymaps.org) or you can find us on our [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/catenarytransit/discussions).

Now, let's get head down into the mines.
