# Welcome, brave new contributor!

Alright, so you checked out our project, and you decided that you want to pitch in. Now what?

Great news: We don't require any background! All you need to start is something that can run code, some time, and willingness to learn! And since you're here already, you've probably got all three. 

Now, you might be asking what the bad news is...

Well, it depends: There's a bit of reading you have to do, but we did our best to lay it out for you. And if you have any questions about *anything* from what an Iter in Rust does to when Kyler will do another maid costume ride. Go ahead and ask us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bBeDhrzSgz) or on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/catenarytransit/discussions) page!

If you want to ask a question privately, or you're not sure where to start, email board member Samuel Sharp (samuel@catenarymaps.org) and we can figure out who to ask.

Now, let's head down into the mines.
