# Routing

How do I get from point A to point B? This is the question that our devs at Catenary are currently trying to solve. One highly requested (and essential) map feature is the ability to find routes between locations and plan trips ahead of time. For example, if you were on a trip in an unfamiliar area, you might want to figure out what buses/trains to take or how to walk to the stations. This sort of feature exists in many other map programs, but Catenary has yet to implement one. It's in the works, and we can use your help! 
Now, let's get into the juicy bits. It's going to get a lot more technical from here out, unfortunatly, there's no avoiding it. Ready?
Routing is the process by which a path is found between two points on a graph. No, not the y = f(x) kind of graph, we're talking about another kind hereâ€”the data structure! But more on that later.
