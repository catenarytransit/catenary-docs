# Backend Quick Start Guide

Flash lesson to getting started with the Catenary Backend

1. Download support for our backend language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Make sure you get the right version for your computer architecture!

    1.  Open your terminal and run 
            rustup update
    to make sure everything works and is up to date!

    2. If you're using VSCode, we highly recomment installing the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) package

    3. If you don't know Rust, now it's your chance to learn it! Here is the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), official [code examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/), and [basic course](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) if you're interested.

3. Now for the next part, GitHub! For those unfamiliar with it, GitHub is a code-sharing platform that uses the Git version control protocol to keep track of a software project's code. We use it so that all of our team members can work together on the project at any time.
