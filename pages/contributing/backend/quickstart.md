# Backend Quick Start Guide

Flash lesson to getting started with the Catenary Backend

1. Download support for our backend language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Make sure you get the right version for your computer architecture!

    1. Open your terminal and 'rustup update' to make sure everything works and is up to date!

    2. If you're using VSCode, we highly recomment installing the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) package; it provides a lot of assistance with syntax and functions.

    3. If you don't know Rust, now it's your chance to learn it! Here is the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), official [code examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/), and [basic course](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) if you're interested.
