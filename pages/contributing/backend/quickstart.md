# Backend Quick Start Guide
Flash lesson to getting started with the Catenary Backend

## Rust 
Download support for our backend language, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Make sure you get the right version for your computer architecture!

1. Open your terminal and 'rustup update' to make sure everything works and is up to date!

2. If you're using VSCode, we highly recomment installing the [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) package; it provides a lot of assistance with syntax and functions.

3. If you don't know Rust, now it's your chance to learn it! Here is the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), official [code examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/), and [basic course](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) if you're interested. If you have any questions, remember that our devs are availbie for help and support in our Discord Community!

4. Make sure you're caught up with all of the details about GitHub and Workflow

## Picking your project(s)

Now comes a big decision: What part of the backend do you want to start with? There are many components that we're working on, and they all play different roles in the operation of Catenary Maps. Here's a quick overview of the main components: 

### Database and Ingestion

### Distributed Systems

### Routing Engine

### Route Generation
