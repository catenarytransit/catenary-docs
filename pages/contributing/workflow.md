# Workflow

Let's introduce you to the Catenary workflow. Make sure you read the GitHub page if you're new to GitHub!

As previously stated, Catenary uses GitHub to manage our codebase; it's also what makes us open source—anyone can view and copy our code! To add to our official branch though, we do require contributors to make pull requests through GitHub as a means to promote communication and improvements for our operational codebase. (Note: if you work your way up the ladder as a regular contributor though, we can bestow push-to-main permissions to you!)

If you haven't joined our Discord, it's highly suggested for you to, because that's a speed dial line straight to the other devs! Our Guides are highly active in our server and respond quickly. Guides are maintainers who have been working closely with certain Catenary project(s) and are readily availible to help people out. If you make a Pull Request, post in discussions on GitHub, or ping **@Guides** on Discord, they'll be the ones answering it! As of October 2024, these Guides are:

| Guide                 | Email                                                        | Fun Fact                                                   |

Catenary does not require nor have regular meetings like school clubs or professional organizations; we try to keep everything asynchronous since we have members from a large variety of backgrounds and time zones. We *do* have town-hall like events where we go over relavent topics to our development and activies, and smaller teams may decide to schedule discussions as well! In addition, if you see anyone in our Discord voice channels, feel free to join and listen and/or talk (respectfully, of course)—we're happy to explain what we're working on or just chat with our community!
