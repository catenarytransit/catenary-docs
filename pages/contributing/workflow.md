# Workflow

Let's introduce you to the Catenary workflow.

After you clone your target repository, make sure you follow these steps every time you work on code:

1. Run 'git pull'. In simpliest terms, it updates the version of code on your machine to the online version by fetching any new changes to the code since you last worked on it, and mergeing it with your current version.

2. Work on the code! Remember to add comments on any part of the code that might not be self-explantatory. For example, tell us what a certain function is meant to do; it helps everyone else working on the code to know what is happening.

3. Run 'git commit -am "[message]"', replacing [message] (keep the quotation marks!) with a helpful, concise comment on what you changed and updated during your work session.

4. Run 'git push'. This updates the online version of code with what you just updated! If you ever have regrets, do not fret! Run 'git reset --soft' to just un-push the changes, or if needed, run 'git reset --hard' to COMPLETELY undo your work since you committed. Watch out for this one though, because it will delete any untracked code, including entire files!

If you haven't joined our Discord, it's highly suggested for you to, because that's a speed dial line straight to the other devs! Our Guides are highly active in our server and respond quickly. Guides are maintainers who have been working closely with certain Catenary project(s) and are readily availible to help people out. If you ask something on GitHub or ping **@Guides** on Discord, they'll be the ones answering it! As of October 2024, these Guides are:
