# Workflow

Let's introduce you to the Catenary workflow.

After you clone your target repository, make sure you follow these steps every time you work on code:

1. Run 'git pull'. In simpliest terms, it updates the version of code on your machine to the online version by fetching any new changes to the code since you last worked on it, and mergeing it with your current version.

2. Work on the code! Remember to add comments on any part of the code that might not be self-explantatory. For example, tell us what a certain function is meant to do; it helps everyone else working on the code to know what is happening.

3. Run 'git commit -am "[message]"', replacing [message] (keep the quotation marks!) with a helpful, concise comment on what you changed and updated during your work session.

4. Run 'git push'. This updates the online version of code with what you just updated! If you ever have regrets, do not fret! Run 'git reset --soft' to just un-push the changes, or if needed, run 'git reset --hard' to COMPLETELY undo your work since you committed. Watch out for this one though, because it will delete any untracked code, including entire files!

After you push, the code will be updated in *your* copy (well, clone) of the target repo. If you want these changes to be reflected in the master branch of the repo—that is, the official Catenary copy—you must make a **Pull Request (PR)**.

To make a Pull Request, go to the GitHub website and open the main page for your copy of the repo (Homepage --> Your profile picture in the top right corner, "Your repositories" --> Pick the target repo). There might already be a button on the top right that says "Compare & pull request" there. If so, click it. If not, right below the header text, there should be a bar with a big "Contribute" button on it. Click it, and it should give a dropdown with a button for "Open pull request" on it! Click on it!

(insert image here to demonstrate where to find PR button)

Select the Catenary branch as the one to merge with, and enter in a helpful title and concise description for your pull request. For example, if you fixed the links for some transit agencies, title your PR "Fixed transit agency links" and write a description detailing which agencies this covers and what parts of the user experience this change would affect. 

Now, all you have to do is wait for a response from our team! We will get back to your PR as soon as possible and either give you some tips on how to improve your code, or approve it right away!

One last note, if you haven't joined our Discord, it's highly suggested for you to, because that's a speed dial line straight to the other devs! Our Guides are highly active in our server and respond quickly. Guides are maintainers who have been working closely with certain Catenary project(s) and are readily availible to help people out. If you ask something on GitHub or ping **@Guides** on Discord, they'll be the ones answering it! As of October 2024, these Guides are:
