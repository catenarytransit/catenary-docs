Things we want to work on for New York:
* [ ] Check if the AirTrain Newark data is correct, it seems to have been manually created by Transitland
* [ ] Manually create some data for AirTrain JFK
* [ ] Check if CTtransit Hartford Line has realtime data
* [ ] Add support for NJ Transit light rail
* [ ] Add track numbers to realtime data at major stations
* [ ] Get realtime data for PATH and NJ Transit light rail
