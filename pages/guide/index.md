# FAQs

### Do I need to download anything?
> **Short answer:** Nope! 

You can find our map right [here](https://maps.catenarymaps.org) for both mobile and PC users. 

### *Can* I download Catenary?
> **Short answer:** Not yet!

We *had* an APK (it's basically a shortcut to our website that acts like an app on your homescrean) for Andriod users, but we ceased support favor of developing a proper app. Just so you know, the Apple version will come out even later since the process to develop an Apple app is lengthier! 

Let us know if you or someone you know is willing to help with app development!

### Where can I give feedback?
> **Short answer:** Use this [feedback form](link)!
